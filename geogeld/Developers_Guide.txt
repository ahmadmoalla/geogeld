1. Use only relative paths if possible (configuration only relative paths).
2. Use the {% url %} tag
		Instead of hardcoding individual links, try using the backwards compatible {% url %} tag to achieve the same result. This will give you the absolute URL, so that if, heaven forbid, your Django project moves the links will still remain in tact.
3. Document your code explaining by comments what you are doing, imagine your grandma is reading the code, make her proud :)
4. Use the #TODO tag to mark what is next.
5. Think about django admin when writing models.
6. Put all static files in Static folder (images, js or CSS) define new directory if needed for new types.
7. Put all templates in templates directory. Create new directories for each app.
8. Avoid using third parties app and scripts if possible. Django has an amazing power, let's use it to the max.
9. Write test of your defined models and views.
10. For each new python file write your name and email at the top of the page using the __aithor__ and __email__ tags.
11. For each new view and email , write your name and email into a comment. 
12. Add and correct what you think is wrong in this document or anywhere in the project.
13. Write unit tests if possible.
14. Have a look at this Django cheat_sheet : http://www.mercurytide.co.uk/media/whitepapers/django-cheat-sheet/django10-cheat-sheet.pdf
15. Stick to the Issue Tracking System we are suing. Currently we use the github issues feature, but this will change soon. Make comments and enhance the issues there : https://github.com/ahmadmoalla/geogeld/issues?milestone=1&state=open
