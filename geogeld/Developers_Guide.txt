1. Use only relative paths if possible (in configuration use only relative paths).
2. Use the {% url %} tag
		Instead of hardcoding individual links, try using the backwards compatible
		{% url %} tag to achieve the same result. This will give you the absolute URL,
		so that if, heaven forbid, your Django project moves the links will still remain in tact.
3. Document your code explaining by comments explaining what you are doing, imagine your grandma
		is reading the code, make her proud :)
4. Use the #TODO tag to mark what is next.
5. Think about django admin when writing models.
6. Put all static files in Static folder (images, js or CSS)
		define new directory if needed for new static contents types.
7. Put all templates in templates directory. Create new directories for each app.
8. Avoid using third parties app and scripts if possible. Django has an amazing power,
		let's use it to the max.
9. Write unit tests for your defined models and views when possible.
10. For each new python file write your name and email at the top of the page using 
		the __author__ and __email__ tags.
11. For each new view and model , write your name in a comment. 
12. Add and correct what you think is wrong in this document or anywhere in the project
		if you think no body is working on that particular code you are correcting.
13. Have a look at this Django cheat_sheet : 
		http://www.mercurytide.co.uk/media/whitepapers/django-cheat-sheet/django10-cheat-sheet.pdf
14. Stick to the Issue Tracking System we are suing. Currently we use the github issues feature,
		ut this will change soon. Make comments and enhance the issues there : 
		https://github.com/ahmadmoalla/geogeld/issues?milestone=1&state=open
15. Avoid too long lines of code if possible.
16. Avoid using single qutation '' in your code if possible, use always ""
17. Try always to do small research to find out the best practice before writing new code.
18. You are the master of what you do, feel free to reorganize the code and introduce
		new features as necessary.
19. Sleep well, avoid junk food and maintain healthy life ;)
